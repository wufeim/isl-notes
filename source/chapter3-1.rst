3.1 Simple Linear Regression
=====================================

*Simple linear regression* assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between the predictor variable $X$ and the quantitative response $Y$, given by

.. math::

  Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X

Here, :math:`\beta_0` and :math:`\beta_1` are the coefficients representing the *intercept* and *slope* terms in the linear model.
